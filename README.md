# GroupCart-project

The vision of this project is to create a collaborative grocery checklist app designed for households with two or more people, such as families, roommates, or student housing groups. The app allows users to add items, like  snacks, eggs, and other essentials to a shared list that everyone can view and update in real time. Once someone purchases an item, they can check it off and optionally record the price, ensuring clear communication about what has been bought and how much has been spent. By preventing duplicate purchases and reducing food waste, this app aims to make grocery shopping more organized, efficient, and stress free for all household members.
While several grocery list apps already exist, such as MyGroceries, our app differentiates itself through its focus on shared budgeting and accountability. The price tracking amongst people using the app, combined with a simple and collaborative design, makes it especially useful for groups with limited budgets like college roommates and  Calvin students living together. This unique emphasis on both organization and financial transparency sets our app apart from competitors.
